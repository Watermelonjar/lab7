1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, the biggest reason is the automation, since I will probably forget to do testing when I'm supposed to do it manually. If this project suddenly has another contributor the testing would be uniform
2. No, single functions shouldn't be tested using E2E test which is more for a full test for the user flow in the system
